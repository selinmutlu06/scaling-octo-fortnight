/* recapsule · seeded demo data, grounded in REAL photo GPS + timestamps.
 *
 * Every capsule below sits at the actual coordinates its photo was taken at
 * (read from EXIF), on the real Cal Hacks timeline (Sat Jun 20, 2026, Berkeley
 * Southside). Place names are reverse-geocoded (Nominatim). The iMessage /
 * Spotify cues are the seeded "fake the ingestion, perfect the insight" layer.
 *
 *   places  → capsules (rich, AI-reconstructed memories)
 *   map     → points of interest with real {lat,lng}; discovered=false → locked
 *   moods   → valence/arousal palette (circumplex)
 *   principles / principleEdges → the principle graph (stage 06)
